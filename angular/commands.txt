create new project
ng new my-app --no-strict

install material
ng add @angular/material

test
ng test -> inside angular project, will compile all our application code and specifications using karma `test run`
karma is used internally by our angular cli

ng test is also going to launch an instance of the Chrome browser where the test are going to be executed

hot reload -> we can configure 
we can disable hot reload using `ng test --no-watch`

when use `webpack` we do not need `.compilleComponents()`

jasmine assertion utility method

we use `beforeEach` because we do not want to write same code again and again in every `it` function
just to avoid code redundancy. we use write something in `beforeEach` that is going to be used in every `it` function 
if we have two `it` function then `beforeEach` is going to be called two times

TestBed -> allow us to provide the dependencies to our services by using dependency injection instead 

xdisable() -> to disable the complete test suite of the service
xit() -> to disable `it` function  
fdescribe() -> if we want to focus only one particular test suite 
fit() -> focus only on one test
